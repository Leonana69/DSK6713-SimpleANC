# DSK6713-SimpleANC
A simple active noise control realization on the Spectrum Digital C6713 DSP Starter Kit.

# Software Version
Since the DSK6713 is a very old type of DSP board, the latest CCS version which supports this board is 8.3.1, also you need to install the C6000 CSL Library which is available from [TI: SPRC090](https://www.ti.com/tool/SPRC090).
